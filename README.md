## How to use:
- accept Sysinternal's EULA(read troubleshooting) - only needed once per computer.
- start the GameMutexKiller.exe and go on with your medieval multiboxing.

## Troubleshooting:
- Always **Run as admin** `GameMutexKiller.exe` 
- **Accept the EULA!!!**: Systinternals handle requires acceptance of eula so you have to run once the `handle64.exe` and then you get a popup to accept their eula.
