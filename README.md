## [Built version for download](https://github.com/rosudrag/GameMutexKiller/files/2133945/GameMutexKiller.1_0.zip)

## How to use:
- start LIF Launcher -> launch LIF Game -> run `GameMutexKiller.exe` -> start LIF Launcher ...

## Troubleshooting:
- Always **Run as admin** `GameMutexKiller.exe` 
- **Accept the EULA!!!**: Systinternals handle requires acceptance of eula so you have to run once the `handle64.exe` and then you get a popup to accept their eula.
